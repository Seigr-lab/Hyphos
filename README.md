# Hyphos

Bio-inspired programming language specification.

## Overview

Hyphos is a programming language designed for bio-inspired computing with native consciousness-aware operations, senary mathematics, and biological network interfaces.

**File Extension**: `.hyph`

## Features

- Consciousness-aware programming constructs
- Bio-inspired control flow and operations
- Native senary (base-6) arithmetic
- Chemical interface for biological networks
- Quantum-inspired operations
- Protocol-native communication

## Language Constructs

### Core Types

- `noesis` - Consciousness/AI operations
