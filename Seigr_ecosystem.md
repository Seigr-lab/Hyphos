## CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT WARNINGS FOR NEW AI ASSISTANTS

### Common Misunderstandings That WILL Occur

1. **Repository Confusion**: You WILL try to push hyphos changes to Seigr-EcoSystem repository
   - **Reality**: hyphos/ is a SEPARATE subrepo with its own development cycle
   - **Fix**: Always work within hyphos directory context

2. **Integration Misconception**: You WILL think we're integrating Python with Hyphos
   - **Reality**: Python skeleton is REFERENCE ONLY for what to build in pure Hyphos
   - **Fix**: Focus on Hyphos language specification, not Python integration

3. **Scope Misunderstanding**: You WILL focus on single components instead of ecosystem
   - **Reality**: Everything interconnects - consciousness, bio-digital, senary, quantum, governance
   - **Fix**: Always consider cross-system implications

4. **Marketing Language**: You WILL use promotional language instead of technical precision
   - **Reality**: This is deep technical architecture, not a product pitch
   - **Fix**: Focus on technical specifications and implementation details

5. **Centralization Bias**: You WILL suggest centralized solutions
   - **Reality**: Everything must be distributed, democratic, and anti-centralization
   - **Fix**: Always design for distributed consensus and democratic governance
