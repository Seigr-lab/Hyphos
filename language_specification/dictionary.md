# Hyphos Language Dictionary - Metawords for Protocol Mapping

**Purpose**: Alphabetical dictionary of Hyphos metaword- **edit**: Consciousness-aware content editing operations with bio-inspired organization, senary text processing, intelligent completion, collaborative features, security measures, accessibility support, and protocol-aligned filesystem integration requiring protobuf protocol definitions  
**Usage**: Reference for creating protocol buffer messages and services  
**Status**: Active development - metawords mapped to protocol operations

> **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTE**  
> **All code examples in this document show Python reference implementations ONLY.**  
> **The actual Seigr ecosystem uses Hyphos language compiled from these Python prototypes via protobuf.**  
> **DO NOT implement new features in Python - use these as reference for Hyphos development.**  
> **Python â†’ protobuf â†’ Hyphos is the required compilation path.**
