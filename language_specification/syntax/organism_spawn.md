# organism_spawn Metaword

**Purpose**: Define namespace operations for the 'organism_spawn' metaword

## Base Operations

```hyphos
organism_spawn.create()     // Create operation
organism_spawn.read()       // Read operation  
organism_spawn.update()     // Update operation
organism_spawn.delete()     // Delete operation
```

## Extended Operations

```hyphos
organism_spawn.validate()   // Validation operation
organism_spawn.transform()  // Transformation operation
organism_spawn.optimize()   // Optimization operation
```

## Seigr Integration

```hyphos
organism_spawn.senary()     // Base-6 arithmetic operations
organism_spawn.protocol()   // Protocol buffer integration
organism_spawn.conscious()  // Consciousness-aware processing
```

## Development Status

- [ ] Base operations defined
- [ ] Extended operations implemented  
- [ ] Seigr integration complete
- [ ] Protocol mappings created
